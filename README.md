# Customer Churn Prediction

## üìú Overview
Customer churn, or attrition, occurs when customers cease their relationship with a company. In today's competitive landscape, retaining customers is vital for sustainable growth. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on demographic, account, and service-related data, enabling companies to take proactive measures to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.

## üß© Problem Statement
The project involves developing a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn. Using features like demographic data (gender, senior citizen status, tenure), account details, and service usage (internet service, phone service, online security), the model will help identify high-risk customers. 

By addressing this problem, businesses can implement retention strategies, minimizing revenue loss and improving customer satisfaction.

## üìä Dataset Information
- **Dataset**: `Customer_data`
- The dataset contains information on:
  - Demographics (e.g., gender, age, senior citizen status)
  - Account details (e.g., tenure, contract type)
  - Service usage (e.g., internet service, phone service, online security)
- Refer to the accompanying "Data Information" document for further details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data analysis and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploring and documenting the workflow.
- **Libraries**:
  - Data preprocessing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
